> Please use the below questions as guidelines to help you think and plan your Learning Reflection Report

## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
I’m not sure if I succeeded in the task as expected, because I had some understanding issues with it. I think it would have been more interesting to test an application that was more flawed.
     
## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
I followed the instructions provided and tried to proceed accordingly. I studied the material available in the course modules and tried to follow the teacher’s instructions as well as I could understand them.
    
## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
I don’t feel like I have enough knowledge yet to recommend any tools.     

## 4. Which IDE (Visual Code or Atom or else) have you used to edit files?
I used Visual Studio Code because I was somewhat familiar with it beforehand. 
    
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?
The main problems were related to understanding the task instructions. However, I completed the task as I understood it.

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
Using GitHub caused some minor issues because I haven’t used it much. It was used previously in the basics of web development course.  

## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
I would learn the framework that is most practical for the future. Robot Framework seemed interesting, but I would research which language is the most commonly used at that time.

## 8. Kindly search the term `Tester` `Automation Tester` glassdoor and LinkedIn or any other job search website. Currently, list the skills and competencies that are most in-demand in software testing
When looking at these jobs and the required skills, I noticed some recurring patterns. These skills appeared in two out of three job postings:
-Manual Testing
-Regression Testing
-Test Planning

These skills appeared in half of the job postings:
-Bug Tracking
-Quality Assurance
-Test Automation
-Test Execution
-Selenium WebDriver
-Software Testing

## 9. **Let's assume** that if you are going to continue with the career in Software Testing, which technical and soft skills do you need to fill up the blank in your resume?
I lack several required skills when looking at job postings on LinkedIn. Mainly, I would need to acquire significantly more technical knowledge than I currently have.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
For me, the best way to learn is by doing small tasks alongside the theory, where I can test in practice what is being taught. A difficult way for me to learn is when there is a lot of reading, and the quiz questions are very demanding. Due to my dyslexia and concentration difficulties, I might misunderstand the questions or not fully grasp them. I need a lot of practical exercises.
